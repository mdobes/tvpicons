# TV Picons
Picons for Czech & Slovak TV channels. Most of the icons are taken from [MarhyCZ's Picons](https://github.com/MarhyCZ/picons).

You can preview the icons on [picons.dobes.dev](https://picons.dobes.dev/).

## Local image converting
You need [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) installed for local image converting to png. It also need to be accessible through command line by `inkscape` command.

Use `make convert -- <file>` (without file name extension) to convert target image to PNG.
